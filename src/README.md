# technical-questions
 

An ongoing list of questions / answers organized in JSON (no code challenges). This was created primarily as a personal tool for improvement so the answers will reflect my own level of understanding of the subjects.

The practice of adding data to the document usually goes like this:

1) I write a question down when I see a concept come up *

2) I DuckDuckGo the concept and learn about it 

3) A day or two later I write down the answer from what I retained about it in my memory

As I get more familiar with some concepts, I revise the answers and add more detailed explanations. That's why some answers are "meatier" than the others.

* Most of the time I practice asking questions myself, but I also use this repository for reference (and I thank the contributors): 
https://github.com/h5bp/Front-end-Developer-Interview-Questions

I could have just written this in a text format, but I find this format more motivating as I'll also end up having structured data that I could use for a flash card app.

Each JSON object has 4 keys: 

q - question
a - answer
ex - example that may contain more thorough explanation or a code snippet
category** - general (general programming), web, html, css, javascript, data-structures.

** Questions are superficially categorized primarily to enable more flash card app functionality and some of them may belong to two or more categories.
